                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adults and students are eligible to receive a free annual membership to the LCRC in exchange
                    for promoting the library's services. With their memberships, ambassadors can check out books to take back to their village to host reading circles with their families, friends, and neighbors.
                    Ambassadors that recruit new members to the LCRC gain points as part of an ongoing competition. The winners of the competition are then eligible to pick a favorite book from the library to keep for themselves.
